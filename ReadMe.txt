    Upscreen 2.0
========================================================================

// General Description

Upscreen is a screenshot utility using the imgur API.

This program gets information from the clipboard, if it's an
image file, saves it as a bitmap, converts it to PNG, and uploads
the image to the imgur image hosting service. After uploading
it will open the editor page at the default web browser.

/// Usage

This program is built mainly for screenshots, though this can be used on any image.
If you want to upload a screenshot, press the PrtScn key (get screenshot),
and Ctrl + Shift + PrtScn key (upload screenshot).

If you want to use this on a regular image (on the web), copy the image to clipboard
and again, press Ctrl + Shift + PrtScn key to upload.

/// Compilation and Testing

This is compiled, built, and tested on MSVS 2010 and MSVS 2012 RC
You must supply your own anonymous API key from imgur (it's free!), see app.config
